# Custom-NLP-pipeline
This repo has the code and the file I used to build this custom nlp pipeline for sentiment analysis from social media text data. A pipeline that converts emojis to text with semantic values, cleans the data from any noise without compromising the semantic or the syntax, parses and extract domain from urls...
The pipeline was coded in way that can be customized and adapted to any, if not all, use cases that deals with text data without any complexities.
